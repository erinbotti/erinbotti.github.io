Hi, I recently graduated with my PhD in Robotics, advised by Matthew Gombolay, in the [CORE Robotics Lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My main research areas are `human-robot interaction` and `machine learning` with a focus on `learning from demonstration` and `personalization`.  My thesis research investigates how to improve learning from demonstration for real-world scenarios (e.g., when robots fail or when human demonstrators are suboptimal).  Iâ€™m interested in designing robot algorithms that are effective in real-world applications.  Specifically, I want to develop algorithms that are easy for everyday users to interact with, teach, and personalize for applications such as in-home robots or out-patient care.

This year, I was awarded the P.E.O. Scholar Award, a merit-based award for women with potential for having a positive impact on society.  Previously, I received the NSF Accessibility, Rehabilitation, and Movement Science (ARMS) fellowship to study healthcare robotics for the first two years of my PhD.  Before starting my PhD, I graduated from Bucknell University in 2017 with a BS in Computer Engineering and worked at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  In my free time, I enjoy ceramics, hiking with my two dogs, and fantasy books.
